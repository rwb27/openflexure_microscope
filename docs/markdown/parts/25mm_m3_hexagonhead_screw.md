# Manufacturing Instructions
## Step

These screws are used as the lead screws for the stage; stainless steel is probably best.  The hexagon head fits into a socket on the plastic gears, which is important as the gear needs to rotate the screw.

 
If hexagon-head screws are not available, a good substitute is to screw a nut tightly against the head of a screw (with whatever head type you can get hold of).  The nut will then take the place of the hexagon head and the screw can still be turned by the thumbwheel or gear.  It's best to use a 30mm screw for the central actuator, and a 25mm screw for each of the two outer actuators if you're going to make that substitution.

* OpenFlexure Microscope: Microscope Parameters                   *
*                                                                 *
* This is the top-level configuration file for the OpenFlexure    *
* microscope, an open microscope and 3-axis translation stage.    *
* It gets really good precision over a ~10mm range, by using      *
* plastic flexure mechanisms.                                     *
*                                                                 *
* Generally I've tried to put parts (or collections of closely    *
* related parts) in their own files.  However, all the parts      *
* depend on the geometry of the microscope - so these parameters  *
* are gathered together here.  In general, the ones you might     *
* to change are towards the top!  Lower-down ones are defined in  *
* terms of higher-up ones - confusion might arise if you redefine *
* these later...                                                  *
*                                                                 *
